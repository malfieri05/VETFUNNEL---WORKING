# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Google Apps Script

1. **Go to Google Apps Script**: https://script.google.com
2. **Create New Project** or open existing one
3. **Copy the code** from `google-apps-script.js` into the script editor
4. **Save the project** with a name like "Veteran Life Insurance Form Handler"

### Step 2: Deploy as Web App

1. Click **"Deploy"** > **"New deployment"**
2. Choose **"Web app"** as the type
3. Set **"Execute as"** to **"Me"**

### Step 3: Update Your Website

1. Open `script.js` in your project
2. Find this line near the top:
   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE'` with your actual web app URL
4. Save the file

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Refresh your local server** (if it's running)
2. **Fill out a form** on your website
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check your Google Sheet** - data should appear in the sheet with ID: `1MvmvfqRBnt8fjplbRgFIi7BTnzcAGaMNeIDwCHGPis8`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Data Not Appearing in Sheet?

1. **Check the URL**: Make sure you copied the entire web app URL
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the web app is set to "Anyone" access
3. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools and look for errors
4. **Test the Script**: Use the `testSheetAccess()` function in Google Apps Script

### Email Notifications Not Working?

1. **Check Email Address**: Verify `michaelalfieri.ffl@gmail.com` is correct
2. **Check Permissions**: Make sure the script has permission to send emails
3. **Check Spam Folder**: Notifications might go to spam

### Forms Not Submitting?

1. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests in browser developer tools
2. **Check CORS**: The script handles CORS automatically
3. **Check Form Data**: Ensure all required fields are filled
