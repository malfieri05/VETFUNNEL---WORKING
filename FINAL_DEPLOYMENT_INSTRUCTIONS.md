# ðŸš€ FINAL STEP: Redeploy Google Apps Script

## The Issue
The Google Apps Script deployment still has the old code that doesn't handle URL-encoded data properly.

## The Fix
**You need to redeploy the Google Apps Script with the updated code:**

1. **Open Google Apps Script Editor**
   - Go to: https://script.google.com/
   - Open your project: "Veteran Legacy Life Funnel"

2. **Replace ALL the code in Main.gs**
   - Copy the **ENTIRE** content from `funnel-app/google_scripts/Main.gs`
   - Replace **EVERYTHING** in your Google Apps Script editor
   - Save (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

3. **Deploy as Web App**
   - Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
   - Choose "Web app"
   - Set "Execute as" to "Me"
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Copy the new URL** and update the config

## What the Updated Code Does
- âœ… **Handles URL-encoded data** via `e.parameter`
- âœ… **Handles JSON data** via `e.postData.contents`
- âœ… **No CORS headers** (removed the problematic ones)
- âœ… **Better error handling** and debugging

## Test After Deployment
Run: `node debug-simple-test.js`

If it works, the React app will work too!

**This is the final step - once you redeploy, everything will work!** ðŸŽ‰
